I use java 8 as my programming language.
"main" folder contains all the codes.
"test.jar" is a runnable jar file, and all results are echo to the termainal.
"DefaultGraph.txt" is used to store the graph, which have to follow these rules:

1. Each line in the file represents a node and the edges linked to it. 
2. Words are separated by 'space'. 
3. First word of each line represents the name of the Node. 
4. Following words represents the edges. 

eg.
1 2 3 
2 1
3 1
